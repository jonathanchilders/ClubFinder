Club Finder project for CSE 170 at UCSD

In the interest of keeping the code in our repo consistent and organized:

- Add all data which will need to be accessed by multiple web pages to data.json until we can set up an acutal database
- Add any styling which will be used by multiple webpages to css/common.css. Edit with care because your changes could break other pages!
- Add any styling which will only be used by 1 page to css/page_name.css
- The above rules apply to Javascript.
